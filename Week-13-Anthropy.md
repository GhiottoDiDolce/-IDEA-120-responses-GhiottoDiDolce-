<h3>WEEK 13: Anna Anthropy</h3>

Anna Anthropy’s reading of, “Rise of Videogame Zinesters,” discusses key concepts regarding the new age of gaming due to advancing technology and/or tools
we have access to today. Specifically in chapter 3, the author introduces what is referred to as “disempowerment fantasies,” which focuses on the importance
of players experiencing struggles and vulnerabilities rather than the traditional power-seeking gaming styles. My initial reaction was being very intrigued by
this concept, and was curious where I may have seen it before, or how I can successfully identify it in other games?  

 Pretty quickly my mind began to think about these disempowerment fantasies being seen in the game God of War. The lore behind the game is about a man who loses
 everything, and all sorts of other character perspectives where struggle, failure, and difficulty become part of the reason why players appreciate the game so much.
 
 I believe the idea of being creative with different player perspectives and narratives allow for more diversity of gameplay and more open-mindedness I believe
 towards the gaming world all together. The more the people who play, the more games being made, can all advance the age of gaming and the minds that go into 
 enjoying them and/or creating them. I believe based on Anna Anthropy’s key advice points being the encouragement of more creative game designing, the world of
 gaming can only improve from here and as we enter further into the age of technology.
