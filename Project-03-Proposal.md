<h3>Twine Game Title : Mandela’s Empire</h3>

**Concept:**

  The purpose of this game, “Mandela’s Empire,” is to allow the player the ability to manipulate space and time 
 much like Ashton Kutcher’s character  in “Butterfly Effect.” The player will be able to travel through time
 (past, present and future) and alter the course of Natural Order. The goal is to give the player the power 
 to choose between certain actions to occur that will then impact the course of the present timeline. These 
 actions and/or options of events are motivated by the fascination of “The Mandela Effect,” which we know of today
 as a sort of “glitch in the matrix.” The player will begin by choosing their avatar, of which are all activists’
 and loyal soldiers of Mandela’s Empire. Their avatar will then undergo missions under the rule of Emperor Mandela.
 Successfully manipulate time undetected, and survive the obstacles meant to interfere with your destiny and threaten
 your life. The Emperor must ensure such power remains strictly concealed to prevent it from falling into the wrong
 hands. If the player fails to prevent detection and/or fails to complete the order, it will result in the 
 player’s unmerciful and eternal termination. There is no room for mistakes. There is nowhere to go but forward.
 Each decision made by the player is vital to a successful win of the game (you survived).

 The player must simply… choose wisely.
