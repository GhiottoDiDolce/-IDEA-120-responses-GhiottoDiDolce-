<h3>PROJECT 4: Final Project Proposal</h3>

For my Project 4, I believe that my range of projects do not quite hold one theme that I could incorporate through a specific color scheme. 
So I wish to display a plain black background, perhaps with some white star-like spots in the back. I want the color of each project to be the emphasis
of the entire website. I wish for the entirety of my GitHub website to be shown in all its glory, along with a possible artist statement of the text I used
to base my poem on perhaps. Next I want the three video screenshots of my project 2 to be displayed above the video to give the viewer a more subtle 
entrance to the projectâ€™s theme. Finally, I wish for my game play to take up most of the room, as my narrative game is my favorite achievement that I wish
to display. I believe it has multiple layers that help add an entertaining visual aspect to the viewer. I hope to select a few screenshots of the game so 
that the viewer feels enticed to play it, followed by a link to the game and a link to twine so that the people viewing my website, also have access to the
tools I used to make it.
