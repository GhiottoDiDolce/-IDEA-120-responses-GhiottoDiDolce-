<h3>IDEA 120: Week 06 Reading Response</h3>


After reading chapter 9 of Janey Murray’s _**“Hamlet on the Holodeck,”**_
and the YouTube _**Insider**_ video regarding _**Mandalorian**_ I certainly believe Murray’s
predictions about internet television and inhabiting virtual environments were
successful. A key term used in Janet Murray’s reading was _*“encapsulation.”*_ The
author explains the differences of both _**temporal**_ and _**spatial**_ encapsulation.

_**Temporal encapsulation**_ refers to digital storytelling where the manipulation of its
components allow the creator to successfully utilize those (_now manipulated_) components
to provide the desired storylines.  The concept of _Temporal_ encapsulation is shown within the
YouTube video of the BTS set of LED screens; LED screens and advanced technology work together 
to allow the creator to control the lighting (such as making it night vs.day for certain scenes
of the show), which provide the so-called _**“hyper-realistic virtual environments”**_ and furthermore
represents Murray’s _**“Temporal encapsulation.”**_ 

_**Spatial encapsulation**_ describes how the creator is given the ability to navigate, operate, and alte
r the virtual environment. This is shown within the YouTube video, as it describes how camera
angles are able to move through a screen as if recorded in real location (_including physical
things such as furniture, structures, horses, etc_), another example being when the directors spoke
about the efficiency of altering the LED image components such as moving a mountain from one end
of the screen to the other end.
