**<h3>Week 12: Game Design For Artists</h3>**
  
  
  Anna Athropy’s reading of “Rise of the Videogame Zinesters,” chapter 3 and 4 very well explains how accessibility in gaming and coding can help improve video games.
Athropy emphasizes upon the multiple benefits that are produced from utilizing gaming and coding accessibility, including: a wider range and variety of voices 
participating in the creation for many other different voices as well, this also references the also growing abundance of diversity not only for the voices including,
but also for the products created. By providing such “user-friendly” tools to improve video games, the result leads to more progressive game development and audiences
impacted. With such a larger target audience from gaming and coding improvements to video games, this transforms the gaming world into a new era of inspiration as new
perspectives, ideas, and experiences from a large spectrum of talent, bring about a new foundation of pushing the boundaries of video games/games in general. How 
exciting it is to witness games of all sorts of narratives, gameplay, and platforms, increasingly impacting more and more people, and therefore granting appreciation
for the art of game design.  

  I began thinking of how beneficial the use of “game” creation tools have been to display how we know games today outside of just video games. Escape rooms were one
of my favorite places to go during last summer. When the players are left in the room, it is up to the “game master” to engulf the players into this anxious, thrilling,
mysterious, and challenging environment by attracting our attention to escaping the room as a reward for finding out through clues. The tools provided in the escape 
room allow technology and other resources from gaming and coding, to make the game more “real” for the players. Some escape rooms for example, use voice activated-clues,
touch screen, sensor lights, floors glowing, interactive puzzles, etc. The use of game creation tools creates a successful, limitless, and imaginative gameplay 
experience of escape rooms among many other medias of games thanks to the use of gaming and coding tools.
