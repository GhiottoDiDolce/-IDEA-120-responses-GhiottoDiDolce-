  Authors Cathy O’Neil and Mona Chalabi provide depth and complex insight towards methods meant to mold society’s online experiences. Cathy O’’Neil in particular, believes too many have fallen victim to having “blind faith” and/or “blind trust” in big data. O’Neil focuses on transparency and trust that should be granted to users when interacting with sketchy companies, algorithms, and other scam-likely communicating platforms, etc. Mona Chalabi on the other hand, is more optimistic about the era of technology, and feels its success comes from fixing the flaws found in the experimental stages of such a rapidly evolving era. Chalabi’s method involves the process of critical evaluation of online content provided strictly from consumers, which as a result helps correct algorithms and big data needed for improved safety and trust online. O’Neil and Chalabi’s methods are vividly shown within everyday experiences online such as: advertisements linked and displayed across social media platforms, which can be dangerous if the source of the ad is meant to violate you, your information, or privacy.  

  My father’s occupation involves protecting hospital records of patients attending an important institution with important information that could be extremely dangerous if shared outside of the institution’s control. This has allowed me to be more conscious of the possible signs of such dangers. However, just as technology security evolves, people begin to get creative on how to manipulate it for their personal desires. I was fortunate enough to escape a threatening scam sent to me through my private school email account. This became more alarming to me because my school account is meant to be protected as it contains very personal information, and the breach beyond my school’s control has now only expanded the range of risk connecting to my online interactions and exposure. However, there are some ways in which such methods have aided my want of efficiency. When I begin investing myself in a new subject, item, or story, my online interactions of said investment are calculated to help provide me with more useful content across the platforms to satisfy my curiosity and wants. To conclude, I do not believe the internet would be more useful without Cathy O’Neil and Mona Chalabi’s methods because without caution technology can endanger our lives, however without guidance to this new era provided by the users, accuracy, security, and trust of new technology is impossible.
