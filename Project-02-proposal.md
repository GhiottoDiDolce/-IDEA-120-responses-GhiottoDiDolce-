**PROJECT 2: GREEN SCREEN**

For this project when accumulating ideas upon what I wish to display as my zoom background,
I thought of possible making it seem as though I were giving a speech with the oval office.
I thought it would be humorous to make it seem as though I were of presidential status with my
large crew of security and others around me who occansionally whisper "important" things in my 
ear.

I also thought of perhaps making it seem like I were in a cave with glowing stones above me that perhpas twinkled
and displayed patterned drips falling as well. I find the mystical environment to be more of a challenge especially depending on where the subject (me)
will look as far as lighting within a darker green screen environment.
